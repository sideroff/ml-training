# task
Your first task would be to fully understand the data and present some form of description of what you have found, be it a short presentation or text or simply present it with your teammate in the next meeting. Bellow you will find questions to guide you in this preliminary analysis, but feel free to be creative and try whatever you feel might be interesting.

# marketing
You are given the first dataset: bank-additional-full.csv 
This is a dataset, describing Portugal bank marketing campaigns results. Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls, offering the clients to place a term deposit. If a client has agreed to place deposit, the target variable is marked “yes”, otherwise “no”. 

For the marketing campaign dataset:
* At first glance, are the marketing campaigns successful? Is one type of contact more successful than the other?
* What is the profile of the available customers? Are responsive customers characterized with some specific qualities compared to unresponsive ones?
* How much do customers engage with the campaigns? Does it affect the result?


# ecommerce
The second dataset contains product listings as well as products ratings and sales performance: summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv. The data was scraped in the French locale (hence some non-ascii latin characters such as « é » and « à ») in the title column. The title_orig on the other hand contains the original title (the base title) that is displayed by default. When a translation is provided by the seller, it appears in the title column. When the title and title_orig columns are the same, it generally means that the seller did not specify a translation that would be displayed to users with French settings.

For the e-commerce dataset:
* Which products sell well and how well? Which do not?
* Which are the top merchants? What differentiates them from the rest?
* Is rating a significant factor when it comes to sales? How about the price drop?
